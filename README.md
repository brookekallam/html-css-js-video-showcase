# WebDev Video Showcase

This is a sleek, beginner-friendly HTML project built to demonstrate clean semantic markup, proper document structure, and responsive embedded video content. It features tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—perfect for anyone diving into web development or brushing up on the basics.

## Why This Project?

I built this as part of my ongoing journey to write better, cleaner code—and to show off how even a simple HTML file can look polished, professional, and accessible. All content is wrapped in proper semantic elements, styled for a clean visual experience, and mobile-friendly. Think of it as a "Devflix" landing page for learning the building blocks of the web.

## Features

- Semantic HTML5 structure (`<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- Embedded YouTube videos with descriptive titles and attributes
- Responsive layout with custom CSS (no frameworks)
- Clean, minimalist design with accessibility in mind

## Next Steps (Stretch Goals)

- Add dark mode toggle with JavaScript
- Convert into a mini course template
- Integrate CSS animations or transitions
